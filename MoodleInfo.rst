Short one
~~~~~~~~~

Attend class and take notes. Do homework regularly. Practice Sample Exams. And go to my Office Hours when you need more assistance.



Long one
~~~~~~~~

Cultivating good work and study habits is necessary for doing well in mathematic courses.  You should keep on top of the subject by doing large amounts of homework, regularly reviewing earlier, asking questions in class, and making good use of your instructor’s office hours and the Tutoring Center. If you are having difficulty with some concept or mathematical procedure, you should get it clarified as soon as possible.  If you make mistakes on exams, rework these problems with the idea that you will not make similar mistakes later.  Regular reviewing of older material in the course will put you in good stead when the final exam comes around.  This will help you to avoid the usual non-retention problems that students encounter at the end of the course. You should expect that doing all of these things will take more than two hours of work out of class for each hour in class. Many students find it helpful to spend some of this time working with others in study groups. Some of my former students who were very successful in APM 2555, MTH 2554, and MTH 2775 generously shared their advice for prospective students at https://sites.google.com/site/ttanghia/teaching.




Attendance
##########

Attendance at every class is highly expected. I am checking attendance everyday at the beginning of the class. If you do not miss any class, you will get a bonus 5% (25 points). If you miss one class (two classes), a bonus 3% (2%, respectively) will be added to your grade. If you miss more than three classes, there will be no bonus. An attendance is checked when a student is present at least 2/3 the whole lecture.
