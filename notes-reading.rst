2.2 - Properties of Determinants
################################

Why is it that adding **columns** to each other also doesn't change the value of the determinant?
Can you do both row and column operations? Or can you only pick one or the other?



2.3 - Auxiliary topics
######################

How is any of that stuff true?



3.2 - Subspaces
###############

You *can* do the ``a*x ∈ S`` and ``x + y ∈ S`` steps separately, but you can also do ``a*x + b*y ∈ S`` in one step.

**NOTE:** ``{0} and V`` are subspaces of ``V``, but *only other* subspaces are called **proper subspaces**. ``S``is non-empty since ``0 ∈ S`` is guaranteed.


Any challenging HW problems?



3.6 - Row space & Column space
##############################

Why are these three cases true?
